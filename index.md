Framing the problem
===================

### Questions for client

#### Product and Service Overview
* How would you briefly define your product or service offering?
* Do certain products and/or services speak to different type of clients?

#### End Users
* Who is the end user? What do they know? How tech savvy are they? Do they use old versions of browsers?
* Can the end users be classified into clear “personas” with varying degrees of needs and selection criteria?
* Which user needs are we trying to address? For existing products, what are the shortcomings we need to fix?
* What are the 3 most important tasks for the end user?
* What customer insights do we have available to inform the solution (customer support, analytics, market research, user research, competitive analysis, etc.)?
* At the end of a project or sale or even website visit, how do you qualify it as a success?

#### Competitive Overview
* List a few competitors that you’d consider benchmark companies?
* What differentiates your company and product from your competitors?
* What about these companies makes then stand apart from others?
* What elements of these companies and/or their online activity would you like to model after in your redesign?

#### Search Overview
* Based on what you know right now, what keywords or phrases would “you” use to search for your products and/or service offering?
* What search terms are your competitors targeting?
* Of the words you just listed, which ones would you like to target with the new website?
* Do you have existing content that can support these keywords or phrases?
* Does your existing website and content rank for these phrases?

#### Website Current State

#### Context

### The framing of the problem

* Summarize the task and see if client agrees.
* This product is like "..." but with a "..." Try finding similarities to other products but point to the Unique Selling Point.

Research
========

#### Preferable product walkthrough
* Have end users explain how they work to solve the problem at hand.
* Where are they when they use the tool(s)? At home? At work? On the go?

#### Second best product walkthrough
* Have client show the product, step by step how it's used.
* If possible, record the walkthrough on video.

#### Mapping
* What do different areas/parts of the existing design do? E.g. "Provide information", "Allow for entries" etc.
* Where in the system does the user **get information**? Where does the user **enter information**. i/o.
* Are there areas for interacting with settings and general site specific issues?
* How are these things reflected in the current layout?

Journey Maps
===========

*The relationship that unfolds over time between an individual and a system.*

* Grounded in research (interviews, ethnographic observation, contextual inquiry, surveys)
* Good for workshops with clients

## Contents of a Journey Map
* Original Story. Along the timeline, plot out how the system works today.
* How it could be. Next to original story, plot out ideas for how it could be.
* Questions a user might have at a certain point. “Can I trust this retailer?” or “When will my stuff arrive?”

Fundamental parts of UI
===================

### Information
* Resource: user needs to find something

### Action
* User needs to enter or change something
 

Sketching
========

* Pen and paper: Diagrams or screenshots. Arrows and text showing what things are and which action leads to what.
* Take photos of sketches and email/post them to the team for feedback.
* Miniature wireframe layouts made in graphics program. Stay way from details.

Todo Lists
========

*Use a tool like [Trello](http://trello.com) or [Trajectory](https://www.apptrajectory.com) to document stories on cards.*

### Ideas
* State the problem in the title of the card. State who has the problem.
* Post sketches. 
* Get client feedback on the card.

### Tasks
* Mark each story with the type of task it is (for developer? for designer? for client to answer?)
* Prioritize stories. This is an ongoing task for the client to make sure the most important things are implemented first.

### Potential topics/categories for todos
* Ideas
* Discussions
* On Hold
* Up Next
* Done
* Up for review

Graphic Design
============

### Brand Manuals
* Does the brand/client/product have a brand style manual? How strict does it have to be followed?

### Come up with keywords that fit the product
* Describing the feeling the product should express
* e.g. Strong vs Delicate, Friendly vs Exclusive, Playful vs Serious, Quirky vs Strict, Modern vs Timeless, Simple vs Complex, Clean vs Active/Busy. 
* Take screenshots/photos of other sites/objects/products that express this according to you.
* Always get sign-off from client. Make sure **one** person from the client's side can have the final word to avoid conflicting messages down the road.
* 

### Typography
* Find a typeface for body type that fits the keywords
* Use a tool such as [Modular Scale](modularscale.com) to set sizes of type and elements

### Color swatches
* Select colors that correspond to the keywords
* Use something like [Color Scheme Designer](http://colorschemedesigner.com/)

### Element Collages
* Create [Element Collages](http://danielmall.com/articles/rif-element-collages/) and communicate with clients.
* Show a range of elements rather than a full layout to save time. Client gets a feeling for the look and feel and style, not the details or the ixd. Prevents client from focusing on the wrong things.
* Everything will change so don't believe in there being a "final sketch" in FW/PS.
