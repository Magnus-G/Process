##Product Walkthrough 
*If there is an existing product or workflow*

###Preferably
* Have end users explain how they work to solve the problem at hand.
* Where are they when they use the tool(s)? At home? At work? On the go?


###Second best
* Have client show the product, step by step how it's used.
* If possible, record the walkthrough on video.
