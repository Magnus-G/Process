#Framing the problem

* For whom are we solving this problem?
* Which user needs are we trying to address? For existing products, what are the shortcomings we need to fix?
* What customer insights do we have available to inform the solution (customer support, analytics, market research, user research, competitive analysis, etc.)?
* How will our success be measured?
