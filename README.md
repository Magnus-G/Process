#####Design Process
*An attempt to summarize a design process.*

readme

Project Initiation
=============

*A potential client has a problem they want to solve*

* How will solving this problem help our business?
* Why is our business capable of making this solution a success?
* What are the Unique Selling Points of the client's idea?
* What is the overall goal of the project?
* What are the moral implications of working with the client? Will we be able to sleep at night?
* Who from the client's side will be the one contact person with "the final word" during the project?
* What are the deadlines? Are there any milestones?

Framing the problem
================

### End Users
* Who is the end user? What do they know? 
* How tech savvy are the end users? Do they use old versions of bad browsers?
* Which user needs are we trying to address? For existing products, what are the shortcomings we need to fix?
* What are the 3 most important tasks for the end user?
* What customer insights do we have available to inform the solution (customer support, analytics, market research, user research, competitive analysis, etc.)?

### Context
* In which context will the service/app be used? How important is responsive design?

### Client
* What does the client need? 
* How will success be measured?

### The framing of the problem
* Strip down number of tasks as much as possible to focus on a minimally viable product (MVP) 
* Summarize the task and see if client agrees.
* This product is like "..." but with a "..." Try finding similarities to other products but point to the Unique Selling Point.

Research
========

* How do other companies, apps, sites do this thing? What works and why?

### Product Walkthrough 
*If there is an existing product or workflow*

#### Preferable walkthrough
* Have end users explain how they work to solve the problem at hand.
* Where are they when they use the tool(s)? At home? At work? On the go?

#### Second best walkthrough
* Have client show the product, step by step how it's used.
* If possible, record the walkthrough on video.

#### Mapping
* What do different areas/parts of the existing design do? E.g. "Provide information", "Allow for entries" etc.
* Where in the system does the user **get information**? Where does the user **enter information**. i/o.
* Are there areas for interacting with settings and general site specific issues?
* How are these things reflected in the current layout?

Journey Maps
===========

*The relationship that unfolds over time between an individual and a system.*

* Grounded in research (interviews, ethnographic observation, contextual inquiry, surveys)
* Good for workshops with clients

## Contents of a Journey Map
* Original Story. Along the timeline, plot out how the system works today.
* How it could be. Next to original story, plot out ideas for how it could be.
* Questions a user might have at a certain point. “Can I trust this retailer?” or “When will my stuff arrive?”

Sketching
========

* Pen and paper: Diagrams or screenshots. Arrows and text showing what things are and which action leads to what.
* Take photos of sketches and email/post them to the team for feedback.
* Miniature wireframe layouts made in graphics program. Stay way from details.

Todo Lists
========

*Use a tool like [Trello](http://trello.com) or [Trajectory](https://www.apptrajectory.com) to document stories on cards.*

### Ideas
* State the problem in the title of the card. State who has the problem.
* Post sketches. 
* Get client feedback on the card.

### Tasks
* Mark each story with the type of task it is (for developer? for designer? for client to answer?)
* Prioritize stories. This is an ongoing task for the client to make sure the most important things are implemented first.

### Potential topics/categories for todos
* Ideas
* Discussions
* On Hold
* Up Next
* Done
* Up for review

Graphic Design
============

### Brand Manuals
* Does the brand/client/product have a brand style manual? How strict does it have to be followed?

### Come up with keywords that fit the product
* Describing the feeling the product should express
* e.g. Strong vs Delicate, Friendly vs Exclusive, Playful vs Serious, Quirky vs Strict, Modern vs Timeless, Simple vs Complex, Clean vs Active/Busy. 
* Take screenshots/photos of other sites/objects/products that express this according to you.
* Always get sign-off from client. Make sure **one** person from the client's side can have the final word to avoid conflicting messages down the road.
* 

### Typography
* Find a typeface for body type that fits the keywords
* Use a tool such as [Modular Scale](modularscale.com) to set sizes of type and elements

### Color swatches
* Select colors that correspond to the keywords
* Use something like [Color Scheme Designer](http://colorschemedesigner.com/)

### Element Collages
* Create [Element Collages](http://danielmall.com/articles/rif-element-collages/) and communicate with clients.
* Show a range of elements rather than a full layout to save time. Client gets a feeling for the look and feel and style, not the details or the ixd. Prevents client from focusing on the wrong things.
* Everything will change so don't believe in there being a "final sketch" in FW/PS.
