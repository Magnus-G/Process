An attempt to summarize a design process.

#Project Initiation

*A potential client has a problem they want to solve*

* How will solving this problem help our business?
* Why is our business capable of making this solution a success?
* What are the Unique Selling Points of the client's idea?
* What is the overall goal of the project?
* What are the moral implications of working with the client? Will we be able to sleep at night?
* Who from the client's side will be the one contact person with "the final word" during the project?
* What are the deadlines? Are there any milestones?
