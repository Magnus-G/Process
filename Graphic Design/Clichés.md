# Graphic Design Clich√©s

- Overlay semitransparent image of texture
- Blurry image in the back. Sharp graphics in the front
- Cut-through fat type so you see image in the background, through letter
- If something should be big, there needs to be something small to contrast it
- Contrast between bold letters and light letters. Headlines
- Create as few visual 'blocks' as possible
- Semi-transparent color layer on top of black/white graphics.
