#Graphic Design

###Come up with keywords that fit the product
* Describing the feeling the product should express
* e.g. Strong vs Delicate, Friendly vs Exclusive, Playful vs Serious, Quirky vs Strict, Modern vs Timeless, Simple vs Complex, Clean vs Active/Busy. 

###Typography
* Find a typeface for body type that fits the keywords
* Use a tool such as [Modular Scale](modularscale.com) to set sizes of type and elements

###Color swatches
* Select colors that correspond to the keywords
* Use something like [Color Scheme Designer](http://colorschemedesigner.com/)

###Element Collages
* Create [Element Collages](http://danielmall.com/articles/rif-element-collages/) and communicate with clients.
* Show a range of elements rather than a full layout to save time. Client gets a feeling for the look and feel and style, not the details or the ixd. Prevents client from focusing on the wrong things.
* Everything will change so don't believe in there being a "final sketch" in FW/PS.
